# hello-world
A place for ideas

Hello there! My name is Torrence. I am learning to be a better front end developer at the moment. Acquiring as much knowledge as possible on ES6, Sass, React, and other front end technologies. I am doing this through a consistant approach and trying to learn something new each and every day.
